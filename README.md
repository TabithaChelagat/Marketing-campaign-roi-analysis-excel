# Marketing Campaign Performance & ROI Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project provides a deep-dive analysis into multi-channel marketing performance to optimize spend and maximize Return on Investment (ROI). Using a dataset of global marketing campaigns, I developed an end-to-end analytical solution in Excel, including data cleaning, pivot table analysis, and an executive dashboard. The project concludes with a 4-week strategic roadmap to improve profitability.

## 📊 Business Questions Answered
1. **Channel Efficiency**: Which channels (Referral, Email, Social, Paid Ads) generate the highest revenue vs. spend?
2. **ROI Optimization**: Which specific campaigns should be scaled, and which are currently draining the budget?
3. **Regional Performance**: What are the ROI trends across different global regions?
4. **Budget Reallocation**: How can we reallocate spend from underperforming assets to high-efficiency winners?

## 💡 Key Findings & Insights
* **ROI Powerhouses**: **Referral** (Avg. 31.0x ROI) and **Email** (Avg. 11.4x ROI) are the most efficient channels.
* **Standout Campaign**: The **"Affiliate Network"** campaign achieved a massive **61.3% ROI**, representing a clear opportunity for scaling.
* **Budget Leakage**: Identified that **"Google Ads - Local"** and **"Instagram Shopping"** are currently draining budget with negative or near-zero returns.
* **Regional Success**: Europe represents the most successful regional model, suggesting that its messaging and offers should be piloted in other markets.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (Excel)
* **Data Engineering**: Calculated core marketing metrics including **CTR**, **CPL**, **CPA**, and **ROI %** using advanced Excel formulas.
* **Pivot Table Analysis**: Built deep-dive tables to aggregate sum of revenue and spend by channel and region.
* **Executive Dashboard**: Created a high-level view showing **Total Spend ($175,969)**, **Total Profit ($553,983)**, and **Total Conversions (2,264)**.
* **Strategic Roadmap**: Developed a time-phased action plan based on statistical findings.
